"""Shared pytest configuration for the GreenMachine test suite.

Three suite-wide concerns live here:

**Import paths.** The GM-006 synthetic record builders under
``tests/fixtures/evaluations`` are shared by several suites and are placed on
``sys.path``. The repository root is also inserted so the GM-008 golden harness
has one canonical import name everywhere: ``tests.golden.runner`` and
``tests.golden.stub_scorer``.

**Hypothesis profiles (GM-008).** The deterministic profiles are *registered*
here — registration must happen before the Hypothesis pytest plugin's
``pytest_configure`` resolves the ``--hypothesis-profile`` and
``--hypothesis-seed`` options, and only this root conftest is imported that
early. The **fixed seed 20260724** is supplied through Hypothesis's supported
pytest mechanism via ``addopts`` in ``pyproject.toml``; the CI profile
deliberately sets ``derandomize=False`` so that explicit seed — not a
derandomized derivation — genuinely drives example generation. Which profile
is *loaded* is decided in ``tests/property/conftest.py``, beside the property
suite it governs.

**Network blocking (GM-008).** An autouse session fixture makes every network
operation fail immediately: TCP/stream connections (``connect``,
``connect_ex``, ``create_connection``), datagram sends (``sendto``, and
``sendmsg`` where the platform provides it), and name resolution
(``getaddrinfo``, ``gethostbyname``, ``gethostbyname_ex``, ``gethostbyaddr``)
— IPv4 and IPv6 alike. Every guard raises before any system call, so no DNS
lookup and no packet ever occurs. There is no opt-out flag and no environment
variable that disables it. Local filesystem and subprocess use remain
untouched.

Child Python processes spawned by the suite carry an equivalent guard through
two mechanisms. **Primary:** every test-spawned Python child is launched
through the explicit bootstrap (``tests/network_guard/child_bootstrap.py``,
via ``tests.network_guard.guarded_child``), which installs the guard before
the child payload executes — portably, regardless of any competing
``sitecustomize`` anywhere on ``sys.path``; an architecture guard confines
``sys.executable`` to the launcher so no unguarded child invocation exists.
**Secondary defense:** this fixture also prepends ``tests/network_guard`` to
the child ``PYTHONPATH`` so the ``site`` module imports that directory's
test-only ``sitecustomize`` where the environment permits it. The only
environment key this conftest ever touches is ``PYTHONPATH``, for exactly this
purpose — asserted by the architecture guards.

Pytest configuration itself lives in ``pyproject.toml`` under
``[tool.pytest.ini_options]``, not here.

# Hypothesis profile registration (loaded/documented in tests/property/conftest.py)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Deterministic CI profile. The seed is the explicit fixed value 20260724,
# delivered via --hypothesis-seed in pyproject addopts; derandomize stays False
# because Hypothesis prefers derandomization over a forced seed, and the fixed
# seed is the configured mechanism. In-memory examples only (no persistent
# database), no wall-clock deadline, and an explicit example budget.
# Registration is idempotent.
#
# `suppress_health_check` is pinned EXPLICITLY, and pinned to EMPTY.
#
# Hypothesis fills any setting a profile leaves unspecified from the active
# built-in profile. On a hosted runner it detects CI (the `CI` and
# `GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variables) and that built-in profile suppresses
# `HealthCheck.too_slow` — so an unspecified field silently resolved to `()`
# on a developer machine and to `(HealthCheck.too_slow,)` in CI. A determinism
# profile must never vary with its environment like that.
#
# Passing the empty tuple explicitly blocks the inheritance outright: the
# declared value wins in every environment, and it is the value GreenMachine
# actually wants. **No health check is suppressed** — that is the accepted
# policy of ADR-0008, and it is stated identically in `tests/property/
# conftest.py` and `tests/README.md`. A suppressed check is a silenced signal
# about test quality, and this project would rather see it and act on it.
#
# GM-041.5-HF1 briefly pinned `(HealthCheck.too_slow,)` here. That removed the
# environment dependence but adopted the wrong value, contradicting all three
# policy sources; HF2 supersedes it. Keeping the pin while emptying it retains
# everything HF1 got right.

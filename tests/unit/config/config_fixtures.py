"""Helpers for building invalid configurations from the known-good fixture.

Every invalid case is a **one-line diff** from ``complete_synthetic.yaml``. That
keeps the expected key path obvious and stops a hand-written invalid fixture
from drifting out of sync with the schema.

:func:`mutate` asserts the text it is about to replace occurs exactly as many
times as expected. Without that, editing the valid fixture would silently turn a
negative test into one that asserts nothing.

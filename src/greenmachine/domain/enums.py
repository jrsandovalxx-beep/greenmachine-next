"""The immutable enumerated vocabulary shared by the specification and the code.

Every member's ``value`` is the exact identifier used in ``GLOSSARY.md`` and
``MODEL_SPEC.md`` (a drift test enforces the match), so the ``value`` doubles as
the canonical serialized form. Members are plain :class:`enum.Enum` values, not
bare strings: a :class:`WindowProfile` is not interchangeable with ``"RECENT_7D"``,
which lets the type checker catch a raw string used where an enum belongs.

No enum here carries a threshold, allocation, or sample minimum — those are
configuration (``MODEL_SPEC.md`` §3, §19). These are names only.

"""Domain vocabulary: frozen value objects, enums, and observation records.

This package depends on nothing else in GreenMachine and on no third-party
library. It performs no I/O, reads no clock, and holds no rules: every threshold,
allocation, bucket, and sample minimum is configuration (``MODEL_SPEC.md`` §3,
§19), and every calculation belongs to the scoring core.

What lives here is the shared, typed vocabulary named in ``GLOSSARY.md`` — the
names the Product Owner and the code agree on. All types are frozen, hashable,
and validate their structural invariants at construction, raising
:class:`DomainValidationError`.

Delivered by GM-002; the composite records that sit on top of this vocabulary —
:class:`InputSnapshot`, the :class:`GradeResult` variants,
:class:`EvaluationEnvelope`, and :class:`OutcomeRecord` — are added by GM-006.
Content-derived identity and canonical serialization for those records live in
``greenmachine.evaluation``, which keeps the hashing out of the pure domain.

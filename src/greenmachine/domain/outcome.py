"""The postgame outcome, stored entirely apart from any evaluation (ADR-0006).

An outcome is what actually happened; an evaluation is a pregame judgement. Fusing
them makes a pregame record mutable and hands every reader the future. So the
outcome is its own minimal contract, carrying only game and batter identity and
the single fact backtesting needs — whether the batter hit at least one home run.

There is deliberately no field here for a grade, wager, odds, profit, or
timestamp, and — enforced structurally elsewhere — no outcome-shaped field on any
evaluation contract. Research joins the two at analysis time, explicitly. Sprint 1
delivers this contract and its tests only; no outcome ingestion exists.

"""Strict YAML loading: text in, frozen typed configuration out.

"No dictionaries escape this package" (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.2). The loader reads
UTF-8, parses exactly one YAML mapping under a hardened loader, validates the
shape with the schema models, runs every semantic invariant, and returns a
frozen :class:`~greenmachine.config.schema.GreenMachineConfig`. The parsed
mapping itself is never stored or returned.

The YAML dialect is deliberately narrow:

* **Duplicate keys are an error.** PyYAML's default is last-one-wins, which
  silently discards a threshold somebody meant to set.
* **Aliases and merge keys are rejected.** They are the only way a YAML document
  can make two parts of the tree share one object, and a shared mutable default
  is exactly what a frozen configuration must not contain. Rejecting them proves
  independence rather than relying on the models to copy correctly.
* **No environment interpolation, no includes, no network.** A configuration
  means the same thing on every machine or it means nothing.

File I/O is confined to :func:`load_config`; :func:`load_config_text` does the
whole job from a string and touches no filesystem.

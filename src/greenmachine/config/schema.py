"""Immutable, strictly validated configuration models.

"Rules as data" is the architectural thesis (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.2): changing a
threshold must never require changing Python. That only holds if the data is
trustworthy, so every model here is frozen, forbids unknown keys, and has no
silent default for anything that affects behaviour.

Three rules shape the whole schema:

* **Nothing mutable escapes.** Sequences are ``tuple``; no ``dict``, ``list``,
  or ``set`` appears in a public field. The parsed YAML mapping is never stored.
* **Scoring numerics are quoted strings.** A YAML float has already been through
  binary floating point and lost the guarantee (ADR-0002), so a float is
  rejected rather than coerced. Counts are strict integers, and ``bool`` is not
  an integer here.
* **Allocations are profile-invariant.** Category maximums, component
  ``max_points``, and grade cutoffs live in one shared structure. Nothing under
  a ``WindowProfile`` can restate them, because those models forbid the keys
  entirely.

This module defines structure only. It resolves no bucket and grades nothing.

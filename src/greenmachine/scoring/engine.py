"""The deterministic GreenMachine grading engine (GM-041).

Pure function of ``(frozen InputSnapshot, loaded GreenMachineConfig)`` and
nothing else: no clock, no randomness, no network, no provider knowledge, no
hidden weighting. The same snapshot under the same configuration always
produces the byte-identical result, and every awarded or withheld point
explains itself in the ordered audit derivation — observed value, bucket
bounds, points, reason, rule reference, and any fallback the ingestion layer
recorded.

**The scoring boundary requires exactly one observation state per applicable
component**, counted across ``present_observations`` *and*
``missing_observations`` together. Two present records, two missing records, one
of each, or none at all are all refused with a typed ``ScoringInputError`` before
any scoring or missing-data handling runs. Selecting the first match, or letting
a present record win over a missing one, would silently leave an observation
unscored while it still travelled on the returned result — unexplained by the
audit derivation. The engine refuses rather than choosing, and never mutates or
discards a snapshot observation.

Execution follows ``MODEL_SPEC.md``:

* §5.1 bucketed scoring — half-open ``[lower, upper)`` buckets over a declared
  domain, the terminal bucket closed at ``domain_max`` (§4.1), the highest
  qualifying bucket winning, points never cumulative;
* §5 binary scoring — a qualification predicate over the reserved input name
  ``observed_value`` (the component's own observed Decimal); any other input
  name fails closed until a future ruling defines its source;
* §5.2 fuzzy scoring — the loaded policy is honored by refusing to run
  anything: it is disabled for MVP, and an enabled policy fails closed rather
  than silently ignoring it;
* §8 missing data — a configured ``not_evaluable`` absence makes the whole
  evaluation :class:`NotEvaluableGradeResult`; ``record_missing`` awards an
  explicit zero with the reason on the record; an unanticipated missing
  reason is an error, never a shrug;
* §8.2 samples — an insufficient present sample is still scored and raises
  exactly one advisory ``SAMPLE_WARNINGS`` finding (the frozen result
  contract enforces it);
* §3 aggregation — plain exact-Decimal sums, no rounding anywhere;
* §14 grades from the configured half-open cutoffs, terminal inclusive.

The engine's entire output is Total Score, Tier, Component Breakdown, Audit
Trail, Warnings, and Fallbacks. GM-041 removed the betting-classification
engine: GreenMachine separates evaluation from decision-making, and any
wagering, fantasy, or DFS decision belongs entirely to the user.
